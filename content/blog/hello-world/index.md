This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

### Why this move?

After working as a software engineer for some years now, I have decided to get out of my comfort zone and start this blog where I will be posting most of the stuff I encounter throughout my journey.

I hope to share more with you while also learning. As it’s said. The best way to learn something is to teach it.

### Kind of content

I am a full stack developer, but with a focus on the backend due to my lack of creativity when it comes to user interfaces. So I will be writing mostly about backend technologies using Python and JavaScript. Ooh! And a bit of PHP

Although I find explaining myself through writing hard. I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Are you a programming enthusiast? This one is for you.
